## How it works

This design is a two-channel RC-servo pulse generator. Two asynchronous comparator inputs
(`ui_in[0]` = X, `ui_in[1]` = Y) are sampled and processed by the DUT. For each axis the logic
produces a standard servo PWM frame with a period of ~20 ms and a pulse width between ~1.0 ms
and ~2.0 ms. The system clock is the TinyTapeout `clk` (50 MHz). Reset is active-low (`rst_n`)
and outputs are forced low when `ena` is deasserted. The outputs are:
`uo_out[0]` = PWM_X and `uo_out[1]` = PWM_Y. All other pins are unused and tied low.

## How to test

1. Program the TT board with the bitstream containing this project and select it (`ena` high).
2. Drive `ui_in[0]` and `ui_in[1]` with digital levels to emulate the comparator results:
   - a higher duty of high time represents a larger tilt/command.
3. Observe `uo_out[0]` and `uo_out[1]` on a scope. You should see a 20 ms frame where the pulse
   width varies roughly 1.0â€“2.0 ms according to the inputs.
4. In simulation (Verilog or cocotb), toggle `ui_in[0]`/`ui_in[1]` periodically and check the
   measured pulse widths on `uo_out[0]`/`uo_out[1]`. Keep `rst_n=1` and provide a 50 MHz clock.
